# ReadMe
Project that helps you keeping track of your reading goals in the time you planned.

## Background
Many people assign to one of the New Year's goals "Read one book per month", but then lost track of the days vs pages and suddenly is missing one week to the end of the month and still haven't read half of the book. ReadMe appears to help those people, you add the book and its number of pages, set the period of time you have to read it, and the app tells you which page you have to reach each day to achieve your reading goals.
